# PastModuleWork-RLanguage
A compilation of works from my past modules and self projects that involves R Language Programming

# This is a source where I post some of my courseworks that I believe are relevant to R Language. 

Some of the sources includes courseworks for Introduction to Business Analytics, Econometrics Modelling for Business Analytics and Optimisation Methods in Business Analytics. Throughout my university tenure, I learnt a lot from all of these modules, and I look forward to learning more of all of these in the future!
