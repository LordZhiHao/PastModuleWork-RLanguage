## Setup 

```{r setup, results = FALSE}
## install.packages("lpSolve")
## install.packages("lpSolveAPI")
## install.packages("linprog")
library("lpSolve")
library("lpSolveAPI")
library("linprog")
```

## Question 2c

```{r 2c}
## primal solution

## max Z = 2x1 +7x2 +4x3
## s.t.
## x1 +2x2 +x3 ≤ 10
## 3x1 +3x2 +2x3 ≤ 10
## x1;x2;x3 ≥ 0

cvec <- c(2,7,4)
bvec <- c(10, 10)
Amat <- rbind(c(1, 2, 1), c(3, 3, 2))
res <- solveLP(cvec, bvec, Amat, const.dir = c("<=", "<="), maximum = TRUE)
print(res)
```
As C^t x^hat = B^t y^hat = 23.33, this suggests that both x^hat and y^hat are optimal for the primal problem and dual problem respectively. Hence, we can conclude that conditions for Strong Duality theorem holds at the solution computed by R.
